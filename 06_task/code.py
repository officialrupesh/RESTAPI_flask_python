# List, Tuples, and set
# 1. Create a list, called eg_list, with three numbers. The total of the numbers added together should be 99.
# 2. Create a tuple, called eg_tuple, with a two value in it.
# 3. Modify the variable s2 so that s1.intersection(s2) returns {22,88,9,12}



#1 task
eg_list = [10,80,9]

#2 task
eg_tuple = ("Ramesh", "Suresh")

#3 intersection

s1 = {12, 2, 22, 88, 9, 12}
s2 = {43,23,22,88,9,12}

task3 = s1.intersection(s2)

# print(eg_list, eg_tuple, task3)s
